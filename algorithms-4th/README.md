- How to set up a java environment?

    [Mac OS](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/mac/), [Windows](https://lift.cs.princeton.edu/java/windows/)

- How to approach?

1. Watch the videos before you dive into each chapter.
2. Browse the chapter in book and read the code.
3. Learning by doing, understand it, implement the code once yourself, and run for tests.
4. If you encounter problems, please refer to the codes presented on the [online](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/).
5. Pick some problems from exercises and solve them. The solutions can be found [online](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) as well.
6. Practice until you get it.

We will skip the first chapter (Fundamentals) for now. You can also go through it quickly yourself. 
Those are basic knowledge of java programming.
We assume you have already known most of it. A quick recap should help.
